Goals
=====

(1)	Validate contradictory experimental findings of intrinsic strength.

(2)	How do the density and location of defects modify the mechanical properties such as young's modulus, breaking strength, and crack propagation?

Tensile strength as well as intrinsic strength:



-	Young's Modulus as a function of boundary angle and type.
-	Breaking strength as a function of boundary angle and type.
-	Crack propagation as a function of boundary angle and type.
-	Local stress map

** How to quantity crack propagation?

For above, compare SEDREBO, REBO, and ReaxFF

Also compare uniaxial and biaxial, indentation if possible.
